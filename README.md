# Cohort-Churn-Analysis
## What is Cohort Analysis ?
### Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given eCommerce platform, web application, or online game and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.
### Cohort analysis is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.
### Cohort analysis proves to be valuable because it helps to separate growth metrics from engagement metrics as growth can easily mask engagement problems. In reality, the lack of activity of the old users is being hidden by the impressive growth numbers of new users, which results in concealing the lack of engagement from a small number of people.

### After performing Churn Analysis we build a model for further prediction of churn . The model is built by performing various Machine Learning Algorithms like Random Forest , Decision Tree and boosting methods. At last we select Adaboost algorithm for our final model .
### Hope u guys were able to learn something new and will implement in your ML journey !
